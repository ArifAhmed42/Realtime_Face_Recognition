# Realtime_Face_Recognition

## IT WORKS IN 3 STEPS
1. CAPTURING 30 IMAGES FOR ITS DATASET
2. TRAINING THE SYSTEM WITH THE DATASET
3. GENERATING A DICTIONARY trainer.yml FILE
4. FACE RECOGNITION WITH THE DICTIONARY

Now......
1. Create a directory named "dataset" in the code directory.
2. Run "capture.py" it will capture 30 photos in the dataset directory. ** Have to be careful about the directory**
3. Then run "face_train.py" which will extract info from the dataset by processing those images and generate a dictionary file "trainer.yml".
4. Run "face_recg.py" . A window will open and start to recognize faces with name and confidence level.

**MAKE SURE THE CLASSIFIER IS IN THE CODE DIRECTORY**
